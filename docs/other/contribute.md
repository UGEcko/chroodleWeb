Hey YOU! 
<br>
Do you have information you'd like to share all over the BeatSaber modding community? Chroodle may be the place you're looking for.

> Prior to starting Chroodle, there was a bunch of data and information spread throughout various places like discord servers, github repositories, and even streamable. <br> Chroodle was created to combat that, and to unify as much Heck-related information in one space as possible. This project became even more worthy after porting the Chroodle repository to it's own website, making ALL information Chroodle provides just a few clicks away.

If you believe you have information that would benefit community members who refer to Chroodle, PLEASE reach out.. We would love to integrate any new information you have to offer!

## Lets talk business

Please contact **ugecko** via message request on discord for further conversation.

> Note: I'm 95% likely to decline a message request if it is too vague. To ensure I actually look at your request, please include somewhere in the message you'd like to contribute to the Chroodle website.
<br>

If you don't have any access to discord or can't find me whatsoever, please create an issue on the [ChroodleWeb Repo](https://github.com/UGEcko/chroodleWeb/issues) on github with the "integration request" tag attached.

Thank you for your time :)
