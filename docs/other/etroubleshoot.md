# Error Troubleshooting

Here you can find *possible* solutions to errors you may encounter in several places.

Currently, the areas this page supports is:

* **Heck Error Logs** in the BS console (Includes Chroma, Noodle Extensions, etc..)
* **ReMapper terminal errors**

> Note: Before referring to this page if you are using ReMapper, PLEASE exhaust all of your resources on the [ReMapper Wiki](https://github.com/Swifter1243/ReMapper/wiki). Issues that could be resolved just by reading over documentation will *not* be covered here.

If an error you are experiencing isnt covered here, feel free to reach out for support in the [Heck Discord](https://discord.gg/rrZf3kapeh) or [Swifters Discord](https://discord.gg/rDNuHgWbBT).
